According to MS's documentation, capture-and-apply-windows-system-and-recovery-partitions,
the recovery partition can be captured and applied to a new partition.
I have made it to work on my windows 10 PC.

Warning 1: You must know what the following commands do before you execute them.
Check the link above and MS's documentation for diskpart, dism and reagentc.

Warning 2: Check disk numbers, partition numbers and volume letters carefully before executing commands.

Use diskpart to find current recovery partition and assign a driver letter(eg. O) to it:
DISKPART> list disk
DISKPART> select disk <the-number-of-disk-where-current-recovery-partition-locate>
DISKPART> list partition
DISKPART> select partition <the-number-of-current-recovery-partition>
DISKPART> assign letter=O

Create an image file from current recovery partition:
Dism /Capture-Image /ImageFile:C:\recovery-partition.wim /CaptureDir:O:\ /Name:"Recovery"

Apply the created image file to another partition(eg. N) that will become the new recovery partition:
Dism /Apply-Image /ImageFile:C:\recovery-partition.wim /Index:1 /ApplyDir:N:\

Register the location of the recovery tools:
reagentc /disable
reagentc /setreimage /path N:\Recovery\WindowsRE
reagentc /enable

Use diskpart to hide the recovery partition:
For UEFI:
DISKPART> select volume N
DISKPART> set id="de94bba4-06d1-4d40-a16a-bfd50179d6ac"
DISKPART> gpt attributes=0x8000000000000001
DISKPART> remove

For BIOS:
DISKPART> select volume N
DISKPART> set id=27
DISKPART> remove

Reboot the computer, now the new recovery partition should be working

(Optional) Delete the old recovery partition:
DISKPART> select volume O
DISKPART> delete partition override

(Optional) Check if the recovery partition is working:
Show the current status:
reagentc /info

Specifies that Windows RE starts automatically the next time the system starts:
reagentc /boottore

Reboot the computer and do your stuff in Windows RE (eg. enter CMD and run some tools)

create partition primary
format quick fs=ntfs label="Recovery"
assign letter="R"
set id="de94bba4-06d1-4d40-a16a-bfd50179d6ac"
gpt attributes=0x8000000000000001
