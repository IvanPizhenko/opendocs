Basically, here are the steps:

Disable the existing Windows Recovery Partition by running reagentc /disable

Use diskpart to remove the recovery partition

list disk

select disk # where # is the disk needing the recovery partition removed

list partition

select partition # where # is the recovery partition

delete partition override to force deletion of the recovery partition

Expand the disk using Disk Management, leaving ~1024 MB at the end of the drive for recreating the recovery partition

Create New Simple Volume for Recovery, NTFS, no drive letter

use diskpart to set the recovery partition attributes

list partition

select partition # where # is the new recovery partition

For GPT disks run set id=de94bba4-06d1-4d40-a16a-bfd50179d6ac & gpt attributes=0x8000000000000001

For MBR disks, run set id=27

Re-enable the recovery partition by running reagentc /enable
